# vuscanner
VuScanner is a powerful android tool that check for a website vulnerability. It scans for login bypass if available. If it successfully bypasses then it grabs all the video links and try to create download and playable links.
## Why this tool
We try our best to upload such simulation tool to protect the world from vulnerabilities in future. So we first inform the vendor/organization about the loophole in their system and then upload PoC after 30 days.


## Usage
Type a website URL e.g., example.com

## PoC
This ProofOfConcept was done to further describe that code obfuscation, anti-debugging approaches, whitebox cryptography algorithms and other methodolgies of security-by-obscurity will eventually by defeated anyway, and are, in a way, pointless.
